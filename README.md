### Brief instructions
1. Run file `A3_FrankHannah.ipynb` which loads data, either stored in repository or from the web, prepares data and generates the components for the visualization. PRIO data needs to be dowloaded from Dropbox and placed in the home directory. The Jupyter notebook also compiles the tex file `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artifact.tex`, which produces the actual visualization artifact. 
2. Alternatively, compile `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artifact.tex` which directly produces the visualization artifact, using the components in the repository.
