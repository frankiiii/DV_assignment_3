### Brief instructions
1. Run file `A3_FrankHannah.ipynb` which loads data, either stored in repository or from the web, prepares data and generates the components for the visulization. The jupyter notebook also compiles the tex file `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artefact.tex`, which produces the actual visulization artifact. 
2. Alternatively, compile `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artefact.tex` which directly produces the visulization artifact, using the components uploaded to the repository.
