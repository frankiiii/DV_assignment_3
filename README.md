### Brief instructions
1. Run file `A3_FrankHannah.ipynb` which loads data, either stored in repository or from the web, prepares data and generates the components for the visualization. The Jupyter notebook also compiles the tex file `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artifact.tex`, which produces the actual visualization artifact. 
2. Alternatively, compile `DV_Hannah_Frank_Assignment3_visualization_artifact.tex` which directly produces the visualization artifact, using the components in the repository.
